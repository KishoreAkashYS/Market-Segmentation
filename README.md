# Market-Segmentation
Market segmentation creates a subset of a market based on demographics, needs, priorities, common interests, and psychographic or behavioural criteria used to understand 
the target audience.Companies that properly segment their market enjoy significant advantages. Organizations with great market segmentation strategies enjoyed a 10% higher 
profit than companies that did not do effective segmentation over 5 years. Segmentation is one of the main tools for the further targeting process. In market segmentation,
the market is viewed as heterogeneous and to further the segmentation of the market, it is broken down into a few smaller homogenous subsets of the same market-making 
analysis useful. The importance of market segmentation is that it makes it easier to focus marketing efforts and resources on reaching the most valuable audiences and 
achieving business goals. Market segmentation allows you to get to know your customers, identify what is needed in your market segment, and determine how you can best meet 
those needs with your product or service. This helps you design and execute better marketing strategies from top to bottom.
